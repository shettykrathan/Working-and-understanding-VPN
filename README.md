## Benefits of Using a VPN 😊
- Encrypts internet traffic for enhanced privacy.
- Hides your real IP address, boosting anonymity.
- Bypasses geo-restrictions and content filters.
- Protects against data tracking, especially on public Wi-Fi.

## Limitations of VPN 🚧
- VPNs do not guarantee complete anonymity (the provider can still see your real IP).
- Possible reduction in network speed due to encryption overhead.
- Some websites might block VPN traffic.
- Free VPNs might have limitations in bandwidth, server options, and privacy policies.
